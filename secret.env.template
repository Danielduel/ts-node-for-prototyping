# Copy-paste this template as secret.env
# secret.env is git-ignored - but doublecheck this each push
#
# Technically it is safe to keep those vars in repository
# (as long as your private key stays private :P)
# but making them secret will rise your opsec
#
# If you find those practices insecure - feel free to suggest
# a change in issues of the repo - love to learn from pros
# but keep in mind that this repo is just dirty kickoff for service
# like small discord bot and not k8s-driven cloud with stuff like rabbitmq xD
# 

DEPLOYMENT_USER=for example - in ec2 world it is called "ec2-user"
DEPLOYMENT_HOST=ip or domain here
DEPLOYMENT_KEY_PATH=~/.ssh/private_key_without_a_password.pem

APP_NAME=rename it please
# imo capitalized service name looks better in logs:
APP_NAME_CAPITALIZED=${APP_NAME^}
